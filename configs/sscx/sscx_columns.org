#+title: Topological analysis of SSCx (~flatmap~) Columns
We develop topological analyses for (hexagonal) columns orthogonal to the circuit's flatmap between layers 4 and 5. Each voxel in the circuit's volume is mapped to a pixel in the circuit's ~flatmap~. We use a hexagonal grid in the ~flatmap~ to define ~subtargets~ that are expanded into 3D by mapping each ~subtarget~ pixel back to its original voxel. We have used circuit ~flatmap~ to parameterize white-matter connectivity, and thalamic innervation. Here we use the hexagonal ~subtargets~ to scan spatial distribution of topological quantities such as ~simplex-counts~. While the scientific discussion will be developed elsewhere, here we will focus on developing a configuration of our analyses that we can use with ~connsense~ to run a pipeline that scans topological measurements over the circuits' ~flatmap~.


We start by discussing individual steps of the pipeline. The pipeline config will developed in the subsections [[Path]] and [[Parameters]] of [[Pipeline]] where we put together each step's config.

* Setup :noexport:
In our discussion we will use ~Python~ code. We can interact with the code using this setup.

** Workspaces
We have run ~connsense-CRAP~ for the SSCx dissemination variant /Bio-M/, extracting data that we will use to compute the factology. Here is a list of workspaces we will need to generate factsheets.
#+name: notebook-workspaces-0
#+begin_src jupyter-python
from connsense.develop import (parallelization as cnsprl,
                               topotap as cnstap)
ROOTSPACE = Path("/")
PROJSPACE = ROOTSPACE / "gpfs/bbp.cscs.ch/project/proj83"
SOODSPACE = PROJSPACE / "home/sood"
CONNSPACE = SOODSPACE / "topological-analysis-subvolumes/test/v2"
#+end_src

#+RESULTS: notebook-workspaces-0

We have another ~connsense-TAP~ project defined in,
#+name: notebook-workspaces
#+begin_src jupyter-python :noweb yes
<<notebook-workspaces-0>>
PORTALSPACE = (SOODSPACE / "portal" / "develop" / "factology-v2" / "analyses/connsense"
               / "redefine-subtargets/create-index/morphology-mtypes")
EXPTLSPACE = PORTALSPACE / "experimental"
#+end_src

While test-developing it will be good to have direct access to the ~connsense-TAP-store~ we will use,
** ~connsense~ Modules
#+name: notebook-connsense-tap
#+begin_src jupyter-python
topotap_22 = cnstap.HDFStore(CONNSPACE/"pipeline.yaml", "connsense-2022-12.h5")
topotap = cnstap.HDFStore(CONNSPACE / "pipeline.yaml")
circuit = topotap.get_circuit("Bio_M")
pprint(topotap.analyses)

** Notebook template
Finally, here is a template that we can use to start test-developing. We will deposit the code in a sub-directory, of the directory holding this file.

* Subtargets
Though required to be defined geometically , within ~connsense-TAP~ we represent the ~subtargets~ as a collection of ~node-ids~. The ideas is that we may parcellate a brain region's physical volume into constituent /blocks/, and study how a brain circuit phenomenon varies across the /sub-/circuits composed of cells in these blocks. In ~connsense~ we call these blocks as the ~brain-region-circuit~'s ~subtargets~.

The rat ~SSCx~ has 8 /non-barrel/ sub-regions with a total of 4.5 million neurons. Here we develop topological analyses for (hexagonal) columns along the circuit's (local) orientation of the layers. The flatmap is more or less a mesh between layers 4 and 5. Each voxel in the circuit's volume is mapped to a pixel in the circuit's ~flatmap~. We use a hexagonal grid in the ~flatmap~ to define ~subtargets~ that are expanded into 3D by mapping each ~subtarget~ pixel back to its original voxel. Here we use the hexagonal ~subtargets~ to scan spatial distribution of topological quantities such as ~simplex-counts~. We have used parcellation of the SSCx into /conical/ ~flatmap-columns~ oriented along cortical layers to study and parameterize the composition and connectivity of the white-matterinnervation.

** Extract

** Paths
We need to set paths to the artefacts that the pipeline will use. We set paths for the circuit to analyze, and the root space for the pipeline's HDF5 stores, and the HDF5 group for each of the pipeline steps.

#+begin_src yaml
paths:
  description: >-
    The ~connsense~ pipeline needs paths to the input data to load from, and output paths to store data.
    Paths to the circuit must be provided along with paths to the HDF5 archive that will store the pipeline's
    results.
